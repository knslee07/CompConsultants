       "'F.W. Cook has not provided any other services to the Company and has received no compensation other than with respect to the services provided to the Committee.The committee has engaged Hewitt Associates to provide counsel and advice on executive and non-employee director compensation matters. Hewitt, and its principal, report directly to the chair of the committee. The principal meets regularly, and as needed, with the committee in executive sessions, has direct access to the chair during and between meetings, and performs no other services for Abbott or its senior executives.The committee determines what variables it will instruct Hewitt to consider, and they include: peer groups against which performance and pay should be examined, financial metrics to be used to assess Abbott\\'s relative performance, competitive long-term incentive practices in the market place, and compensation levels relative to market practice. The committee negotiates and approves any fees paid to Hewitt for these services. In 2008, the committee authorized payment of approximately $239,109 to Hewitt for services rendered to the committee relating to executive compensation. Separately, Abbott paid approximately $5.3 million for unrelated services, including actuarial work, pension design and administration, and general consulting.The committee has engaged Aon Hewitt to provide counsel and advice on executive and non-employee director compensation matters.  The Committee engaged Aon Hewitt as its compensation consultant for 2013. For 2014, the Compensation Committee has selected a new Compensation Committee consultant, Meridian, whose company performs no other work for Abbott. Separately, Abbott management engaged Aon Hewitt to perform and paid approximately $5.8 million for unrelated services, including actuarial work, pension design and administration, insurance, and general consulting.The Committee engaged Meridian. The Committee engages compensation consultants to provide counsel and advice on executive and non-employee director compensation matters. The consultant and its principal report directly to the Chair of the Committee. The principal meets regularly and as needed with the Committee in executive sessions, has direct access to the Chair during and between meetings, and performs no other services for Abbott or its senior executives. The Committee determines what variables it will instruct the consultant to consider, and they include: peer groups against which performance and pay should be examined, financial metrics to be used to assess Abbott\\'s relative performance, competitive long-term incentive practices in the marketplace, and compensation levels relative to market practice. The Committee negotiates and approves any fees paid to the consultant for these services. Based on its evaluation of Meridian\\'s independence in accordance with the New York Stock Exchange listing standards and information provided by Meridian, the Committee determined that the work performed by Meridian does not present any conflicts of interest. The Committee engaged Meridian as its compensation consultant for 2015. Meridian performs no other work for Abbott. The Committee has retained Mercer Human Resource Consulting (Mercer) as its consultant in order to have access to objective, expert perspectives on matters related to executive compensation. Mercer was selected as the consultant to the Committee in 2004 after an interview process with executive compensation consulting firms. In 2006, Mercer advised the Committee on a variety of compensation-related issues, including compensation strategy, plan design, executive and Board member compensation levels, and preparation of the CompensationIn 2009, the Compensation Committee retained Semler Brossy as its consultant in order to get objective, expert advice. Semler Brossy was selected as the consultant to the Compensation Committee in 2008 after an interview process with several compensation consulting firms.In September 2010, the Compensation Committee retained Compensia, Inc. as its compensation consultant. During fiscal 2015, the Compensation Committee retained Compensia, Inc. (“Compensia”), a national compensation consulting firm, as its independent compensation consultant to provide assistance on executive and director compensation matters. Compensia advised the Compensation Committee on a variety of compensation-related matters in fiscal 2015, including: The Committee may engage compensation consultants but did not do so in 2006. Additional information on the Committee’s processes and procedures for considering and determining executive compensation is contained in the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” section of this Proxy Statement.The Committee may engage compensation consultants but did not do so in 2007. Additional information on the Committee’s processes and procedures for considering and determining executive compensation is contained in the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” section of this Proxy Statement.The Committee has the authority to retain and terminate any independent, third-party compensation consultant and to obtain advice and assistance from internal and external legal, accounting and other advisors. Since 2014, the Compensation Committee has engaged the services of Pay Governance LLC (“Pay Governance”), an independent executive compensation consulting firm. During 2015, Pay Governance did not provide any other services to Apple and worked with Apple’s management, as directed by the Compensation Committee, only on matters for which the Compensation Committee is responsible. In 2014, the Compensation Committee selected and directly retained the services of Pay Governance LLC, an independent executive compensation consulting firm. Pay Governance did not provide any other services to the Company and worked with the Company’s management, as directed by the Compensation Committee, only on matters for which the Compensation Committee is responsible. The Compensation Committee assessed the independence of Pay Governance pursuant to SEC and NASDAQ rules and concluded that no conflict of interest exists that would prevent Pay Governance from serving as an independent consultant to the Compensation Committee.From time to time, the Committee engages CCA Strategies LLC, an employee benefits 6 and compensation consulting firm (which also acts as a consultant to the Human Resources Committee on executive compensation matters), to provide the Committee with information regarding director compensation paid by companies principally in the Fortune 50, Fortune 100 and a special comparator group used by the Human Resources Committee. The Committee has selected Total Rewards Strategies to serve as its independent consultant. The consultant reports directly to the Committee. Total Rewards Strategies provides no other services to AT&T.From time to time, the Committee engages Total Rewards Strategies, LLC, an employee benefits and compensation consulting firm (which also acts as a consultant to the Human Resources Committee on executive compensation matters), to provide the Committee with information regarding director compensation paid by other public companies.In 2011, Meridian served as the Compensation Committee’s outside compensation consultant. Meridian was retained by, and reported directly to, the Compensation Committee during its engagement as compensation consultant. As outside compensation consultant, Meridian provided the following services and information to the Compensation Committee:The Compensation Committee has engaged an external executive compensation consulting firm, Mercer HR Consulting, to advise it on matters including, but not limited to, annual adjustments to Senior Officer pay levels, market practices regarding incentive plan design, and employment contracts, among other matters. The Compensation Committee has the sole authority to continue or terminate its relationship with Mercer.The Committee has retained Semler Brossy to advise on our executive compensation programs. Aside from services to the Committee and other Board members, Semler Brossy performs no other services for us.In 2010, Semler Brossy provided no services to the Company apart from work performed for the Committee and the Committee has determined that Semler Brossy is independent.A consultant is considered not independent if it provides significant services to the Company apart from work performed for the Committee (services in excess of $50,000 or 1% of the consulting firm’s gross revenues for the most recent fiscal year). In 2009, the Committee determined that Semler Brossy is independent.The Compensation Committee has directly engaged George B. Paulin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Frederic W. Cook& Co., Inc. as its compensation consultant. Mr.Paulin reports directly to the Committee and is responsible for reviewing Committee materials, attending Committee meetings, assisting the Committee with program design and generally providing advice and counsel to the Committee as compensation issues arise. The Committee also looks to Mr.Paulin for assistance in determining the competitiveness of Baxter’s total compensation structure. From time to time, Hewitt Associates assists the Committee with the compilation of market data.Additionally, Aon Hewitt assists the Compensation Committee with the compilation of market data from time to time. Mr. Paulin reports directly and exclusively to the Compensation Committee and his firm provides no other services to Baxter except advising on executive and Board compensation matters. He provides analyses and recommendations that inform the Compensation Committee’s decisions, but he does not decide or approve any compensation actions. During 2015, he advised the Compensation Committee Chairman on setting agenda items for Compensation Committee meetings; reviewed management proposals presented to the Compensation Committee; assisted in the Compensation Committee’s assessment of Baxter’s compensation policies and practices (and those established for Baxalta prior to the Baxalta spin-off); and conducted a review of the compensation of non-employee directors at Baxter’s peer companies. This group, which was engaged by the Committee, works with the Committee (including the Subcommittee) and management to assure the Committee and Subcommittee that executive compensation is competitive and appropriate in view of our goals. The Committee periodically undertakes a comprehensive review of our compensation programs. The last such review was completed at the start of fiscal 2007 when we reviewed the form of executive officer employment agreements. Currently these relate to global pension actuarial and investment services as well as other global retirement plan and compensation consulting services. We have not engaged a separate consultant for purposes of executive compensation.The Committee has engaged Semler Brossy as its consultant for executive compensation. The Committee determined that Semler Brossy is free of conflicts of interest. The consultant reports directly to the Committee and works with the Committee (and the Subcommittee) and management to, among other things, provide advice regarding compensation structures in general and competitive compensation data. The consultant also reviews information prepared by management for the Committee and/or Subcommittee. All of the decisions with respect to determining the amount or form of executive compensation under our executive compensation programs are made by the Committee or Subcommittee alone and may reflect factors and considerations other than the information and advice provided by the consultant. No other services were provided by Semler Brossy to the Committee, Subcommittee, or Company. The Company engaged separate consultants, Towers Watson and The Hay Group, to supplement its internal resources and assist with compensation matters in general and with executive compensation as well.Until September 2009, a small group of consultants within Mercer, Inc. (\"Mercer\") had served as the Compensation Committee\\'s executive compensation consultant for a number of years. In September 2009, members of the group left Mercer and formed Compensation Advisory Partners (\"CAP\"), which is now the firm engaged by, and reporting directly to, the Compensation Committee. While at Mercer, the group was engaged by, and reported directly to, the Committee without input from management. The consultants, when they were at Mercer and now at CAP, work with the Committee (including the Subcommittee) and management and, among other things, provide advice regarding compensation structures generally and competitive compensation data and review for the Committee and/or Subcommittee information prepared by management. All of the decisions with respect to determining the amount or form of executive compensation under the Company\\'s executive compensation programs are made by the Committee or Subcommittee alone and may reflect factors and considerations other than the information and advice provided by the consultants. The Committee periodically undertakes a comprehensive review of our compensation programs. During fiscal 2009, the Committee and Subcommittee considered improvements to the programs for fiscal 2010 to make them more consistent with the fiscal 2013 strategy. The Committee had been aware that during the engagement of Mercer other consultants and employees within Mercer and its affiliates provided a range of consulting and other services to us. Neither the Committee nor the Board of Directors approved the additional services, which related to global pension actuarial and investment services, global retirement plan and compensation consulting services and insurance brokerage services. For fiscal 2010, fees paid to Mercer for executive compensation consulting services amounted to $40,000. No fees were paid for director compensation services. Fees paid to Mercer and its affiliates for other services amounted to $4.1 million. As previously noted, the Committee and Subcommittee are no longer using Mercer as a consultant. In order to supplement its internal resources and to help the Committee and Subcommittee as necessary, the Company has engaged a separate consultant, Towers Watson, to assist with compensation matters in general and with executive compensation as well.The Compensation Committee has engaged Compensation Advisory Partners (\"CAP\") as its consultant for executive compensation purposes. All of the decisions with respect to determining the amount or form of executive compensation under the Company\\'s executive compensation programs are made by the Committee or Subcommittee alone and may reflect factors and considerations other than the information and advice provided by the consultants. In order to supplement its internal resources and to help the Committee and Subcommittee as necessary, the Company has engaged a separate consultant, Towers Watson, to assist with compensation matters in general and with executive compensation as well.The Compensation Committee has engaged Semler Brossy as its consultant for executive compensation beginning in January 2013. The Committee determined that Semler Brossy is free of conflicts of interest. Semler Brossy replaced Compensation Advisory Partners (\"CAP\"), which had been the Committee\\'s consultant for a number of years, including the start of fiscal 2013. The consultants report directly to the Compensation Committee and work with both the Committee (including the Subcommittee) and management to, among other things, provide advice regarding compensation structures in general and competitive compensation data. They also review for the Committee and/or Subcommittee information prepared by management. All of the decisions with respect to determining the amount or form of executive compensation under our executive compensation programs are made by the Committee or Subcommittee alone and may reflect factors and considerations other than the information and advice provided by the consultants. The Company engaged a separate consultant, Towers Watson, to supplement its internal resources and assist with compensation matters in general and with executive compensation as well.ExxonMobil management uses different consulting firms to advise on ExxonMobil’s general employee compensation and benefit programs.
