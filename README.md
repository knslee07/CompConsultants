# CompConsultants
This is a repo for python scripts and jupyter notebooks to train and finetune the RNN to find compensation consultants from a vast amount of text data.

## File Explanations
- The uploaded files were used to train SpaCy's RNN network to perform a named entity recognition (NER) of compensation consultants from company proxy statements.
- The proxy statements were downloaded on my local machines, but it can be easily downloaded via SEC Edgar.
- TRAIN_DATA.py shows part of the annotated sentences for training. There are additional training set files (available upon request).
- The Jupyter notebooks in the namesake folder were used to test, verify, and clean the initial results and write the py files.
